# Machine learning for the prediction of virtual reality sickness 

Predict cybersickness with a machine learning approach.

We collected data from a user study which we collected the HMD eye screen video, the head movement, and the player's demographic information. We extracted features from the raw data, and build machine learning models to predict cybersickness score.
